# Connect4
C++ project based on the popular Connect 4 game.

Currently this project is a two player game where the users are playing against each other. 
The program uses two dimensional arrays to create the playing board and takes inputs from users to place the checkers. 
Next, tuns are exchanged between players and this process repeats until four checkers have been placed side by side and a winner can be determined.
