# Connect4
C++ project based on the popular Connect 4 game.

Currently this project is a two player game where the users are playing against each other. 
The program uses two dimensional array to create the playing board and takes input from users to place the checkers. 
Next, turns are exchanged between players and this process repeats until four checkers have been placed side by side and a winner is determined.

P.S.: working on a player vs computer mode!
